Hello, @arnav, could you please give a brief description of the project?


[06/20/2022 6:42 PM] arnav.vohra
Yup, we are building an NFT fractionalization protocol which uses bonding curve for trading and a valuation based buyout mechanism. You can actually try out the beta on rinkeby : https://beta.nibbl.xyz/ and get an overview of our architecture here : https://youtu.be/dJFOgo58qVg. I'll wait for the contest to start before sharing more info.

#NFTs once fractionalized shouldn’t stay locked in a contract forever. Our unique buyout rejection game allows fractionalization to work smoothly as a two-way process. 

Here’s how the game works. 👇

User addresses, user id and token address


[06/23/2022 6:03 AM] elku.cryptos
maybe a newbie question.. 

require(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, 0), "withdraw:not allowed");

can someone tell how does this line work with a tokenId of zero?


[06/23/2022 6:28 AM] _mundhrakeshav
This basically checks that the msg.sender is owner or is approved to transfer the 0th token.

going through documentation. what's reserve ratio?


[06/23/2022 2:41 PM] arnav.vohra
It refers to reserve ratio of the bonding curve - we use bancor bonding curve


[06/23/2022 2:45 PM] eccentricexit
Why does nibbl use create2 instead of create?


[06/23/2022 3:07 PM] blockdev
I meant to say what is it the ratio of?


[06/23/2022 4:55 PM] arnav.vohra
Reserve ratio is a theoretical term and is defined as Liquidity/Valuation. It helps in defining the shape of the bonding curve


[06/23/2022 5:01 PM] _mundhrakeshav
Majorly to improve user onboarding and UX by precomputing it, we plan to build some stuff on this protocol.

If this would have been a private firm, it would have cost a lot of $$$ to audit it

We did get an audit done on these contracts as well but I agree that the code can be much better. Anything specific you feel we could have improved?

some files contains diff. versions . are you using this  to test ur code or either its not good practice to use different version. aka floating pragma issue.

You'll be able to access them once the audit report is published.  At that point, we make the findings repo public as well.

Hi, I also submitted few gas and qa issues. But I cannot see my name here. Is there something wrong with my reports?


[07/12/2022 12:43 AM] 100proof
Is it possible that you submitted multiple gas/QA reports?


[07/12/2022 12:44 AM] sm4rty_
Yes,

However, the Nibbl contest was longer than 10 days ago.


[07/12/2022 12:49 AM] sm4rty_
Oh, I got it!!


[07/12/2022 12:49 AM] 100proof
Did you submit a Help request to remove the duplicate findings?


[07/12/2022 12:50 AM] sm4rty_
No, but all my recent contest findings, I merged it into one for qa and one for gas.
